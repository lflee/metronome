# Web Audio Metronome

Originally written by Chris Wilson. I now try to modify it according to my actual needs like adding -
- typing tempo input in addition to the existing slider
- 8th note tripet

It basically works. 
Do let me know if you have any comments or feedback.

This application shows how to use a collaboration between a setTimeout scheduler and the Web Audio scheduler to properly implement rock-solid timing for audio applications.
